We should love, and take care of it the way it has nurtured and inspired us with its beauty over the years. This fuels our mission to recognize that our planet is our one and only home.",
            "cnt_4": "While the color blue symbolizes depth and stability. As a business, which has been around for 20 years, we have proven that we are continuously moving towards the direction of strength and security. The V works with trust, loyalty, wisdom, and truth as its founding values.",

            "cnt_9": "In another sense, the figure “1” also evokes our innate aspiration as humans to be part of something big, and in the process of playing the role we’ve chosen to take, we always aspire to be on top, to be the best in what we do.",
            "cnt_10": "Overall the V-Malaysia 2018 logo evokes simplicity and intelligence. As we anticipate the homecoming of dreamers this April 24-28, 2018 we welcome them with open arms and renewed love for the planet, appreciation of our oneness, and recognition of our one purpose."
